# Module 5: Architecture & Design II

## Objective
To understand advanced security architecture concepts and how secure design principles help protect systems and data.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Secure design principles
- Network segmentation
- Zero Trust architecture
- Secure system components
- Defense-in-depth (advanced application)

## What I Learned
- Secure design reduces vulnerabilities from the start
- Network segmentation limits lateral movement
- Zero Trust assumes no implicit trust
- Architecture decisions directly impact security posture
- Layered defenses improve resilience

## Real-World Relevance
Modern organizations rely on secure architecture and design to prevent breaches and reduce the impact of attacks.

## Summary
This module reinforced the importance of building security into system architecture and design from the beginning.
