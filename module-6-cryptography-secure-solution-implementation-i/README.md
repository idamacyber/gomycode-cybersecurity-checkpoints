# Module 6: Cryptography & Secure Solution Implementation I

## Objective
To understand cryptographic concepts and how secure solutions are implemented to protect data and communications.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Encryption and decryption
- Symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography
- Hashing and digital signatures
- Certificates and PKI
- Secure implementation practices

## What I Learned
- Encryption protects data confidentiality
- Asymmetric cryptography enables secure key exchange
- Hashing ensures data integrity
- Digital signatures provide authentication and non-repudiation
- Secure implementation is as important as strong algorithms

## Real-World Relevance
Cryptography is used in HTTPS, VPNs, secure storage, and authentication systems to protect sensitive information.

## Summary
This module introduced essential cryptographic concepts and showed how they are applied in real-world secure systems.
